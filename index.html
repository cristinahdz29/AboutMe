    <h1>Welcome! Nice to meet you! 👋🏼</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Cristina (you can just call me Cristina) and I am
      originally from Glennville, GA. I moved to Atlanta almost a year ago and
      have been slowly exploring the city ever since! I am married to my best
      friend and have 2 cats, Peluza ( Spanish for 'fluffy') and Kylo. I
      graduated from Georgia Southern University in 2017 with a bachelor's
      degree in biological sciences.

      In my spare time, I enjoy tending to my newly acquired plant collection
      and scouring instagram for new ones to adopt! :)

      P.S. If you are interested in adding some greenery to your space and would
      like to shop local, I suggest checking out

      plant shop. 🌿
